<h3>If you mostly answered A's:</h3>
<p>You're the kind of person that doesn't like strenuous tasks and would rather take it slow, and that's great! Just remember that in order to have a healthier lifestyle, building muscle and pushing through is also a good thing. As for a diet, eating fruits is good in moderation. Remember to also eat lots of protein and carbs when you do strenuous exercise like running or swimming.</p>
<br>
<h3>If you mostly answered B's:</h3>
<p>You're big on building muscle and looking your best at all times. You are self-conscious about your body and rely on heavy lifting. Make sure to always stretch and properly lift to prevent injury. Take a break from lifting and try yoga or swimming to stretch out your muscles. People that do strenuous exercises usually supplement their daily nutrition with protein shakes. This is only beneficial once in a while and should not be consumed if strenuous exercise was not preformed. The protein shakes also contain excessive amounts of sugar to replace the sweat you've lost. Therfore, your diet should also include carbs, veggies, fruits, and grains. </p>
<br>
<h3>If you mostly answered C's:</h3>
<p>Your diet and exercise is really good! Be sure to consume lots of carbs and protein in addition to your veggie diet in order to regain energy. However, don't mistake carbs for junk food. Carbs can include pizza, pasta, bread, etc.</p>
<br>
<h3>If you mostly answered D's:</h3>
<p>Your lifestyle could be greatly improved. Exercise and healthy eating directly impact how you act around others and your overall attitude for the day. Lack of exercise has shown to cause anxiousness, stress, and mood swings. To start, pick an activity that's low-key and doesn't require too much strength or endurance, like yoga. Start with 5-10 mins a day and then increase the duration as the weeks go by. With that, be sure to slowly move away from consuming junk food and switch to fruits to satify your sugar cravings. You'll be feeling great about yourself in no time!</p>
